## What is Over / Under?

Over / Under is a sports app that allows you to search for 2 teams which will result in some basic statistics from their matchups this season. 

Simple things like:
-  how many times they've faced each other this season 
- the outcome of those games 
- and most importantly the total points scored in that game

 You'll also get an averaged total of points from each time they've faced each other this season. 
 
 These stats are provided in order to help the user determine whether they should place a bet on the Over or the Under the next time these 2 teams face.
